\title{Buffer points in XY space}
\usage{
buffer.f(foo, buffer, reps)
}
\arguments{
\item{foo}{a data.frame to select from with columns x, y}

\item{buffer}{the minimum distance between output points}

\item{reps}{the number of repetitions for the points selection}
}
\description{
Returns the original data table with buffered points removed.

Runs numerous iterations, as the random point selection can result in more/fewer output points.
\enumerate{
\item Randomly select a single point
\item Remove points within 50km of that point
\item Randomly select of the remaining points
}
}
